## Intro
I have a great passion for statistics, economics, and analytics. In this blog I share anything I discover and find interesting in the area of statistics and data analysis. I post some R codes that I find useful to share. I use R programming language almost every single day and my passion for the language has grown significantly since I started learning during my undergraduate. I also write a bit about Africa and its progress toward development. I will also post interesting stats I find across the web including sports.

Please feel free to contribute or comment on the blog. Below is my short profile.
